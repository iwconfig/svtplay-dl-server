svtplay-dl-server
=================
A websocket server written in python running svtplay-dl through ``pexpect``, taking instructions from inbound in JSON format and pushing the output (including progress bar) to the client.

| The use of pexpect instead of ``svtplay_dl`` as a module is cumbersome, limited and buggy. But this will do for now until I've figured out a proper way to handle the IO.

svtplej.user.js
---------------
This is a client in the form of a userscript specifically for http://svtplay.se. My javascript skills are limited, but this get the job done and I'm pretty happy with it.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Python 3.6
- websockets module
- pexpect module
- svtplay-dl
- Web browser with Tampermonkey (userscript manager)*

\*I haven't tested the userscript with other managers but they *should* work as well

Install and run
~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Install Tampermonkey
2. Go to the userscript in 'client' directory here in the repository on github
3. Click on the 'Raw' button and Tampermonkey should pick it up with a prompt for installation.
4. Install the server: ::

    cd $HOME
    git clone https://github.com/iwconfig/svtplay-dl-server.git
    sudo cp svtplay-dl-server-master/svtplay-dl-server.py /usr/local/bin/svtplay-dl-server

5. Run the server on a custom* host and port as a daemon with ``screen``\*\*: ::

    screen -DmS svtplay-dl-server svtplay-dl-server localhost -p 5050

\* Run ``svtplay-dl-server -h`` for help.

\*\* If you are using Linux and don't have ``screen`` installed, run this: ``sudo apt-get install screen``

Known bugs
~~~~~~~~~~
- Sometimes something this might occur in the servers output: ::

    Outfile: filename [sXeY].mp4 [01/28][=.......................................] ETA: 0:00:00

Todo
~~~~
- Add setup.py
- Ditch ``pexpect`` for better IO with ``svtplay_dl`` module instead
- More clients: Chrome/Firefox extension
- Implement logging module

I'm sure some bugs are occurring with the use of pexpect. Please fork and we can be happy together :)
